\subsection{ASL: A Brief Description}

Let me start by sharing with you \emph{my} definition of ASL:
``American Sign Language is a visually perceived language based on a naturally evolved system of articulated hand gestures and their placement relative to the body, along with non-manual markers such as facial expressions, head movements, shoulder raises, mouth morphemes, and movements of the body.''

Now let's look at a couple of other definitions.
According to \texttt{www.dictionary.com} we have:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{American Sign Language} \textit{n. Abbr.} \textbf{ASL}:
The primary sign language used by deaf and hearing-impaired people in the United States and Canada, devised in part by Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet on the basis of sign language in France.
Also called \textbf{Ameslan}.
\end{quote}

A quick trip to Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary (\texttt{www.m-w.com}) and we get:

\begin{tabular}{rp{10cm}}
Main Entry:&\textbf{American Sign Language}\\
Function:&\emph{noun}\\
Date:&1960\\
\textbf{:}&a sign language for the deaf in which meaning is conveyed by a system of articulated hand gestures and their placement relative to the upper body\\
\end{tabular}

I've also seen this definition show up in \emph{many} places:

\begin{quote}
``American Sign Language is a visual-gestural language used by 500,000 members of the North American Deaf community.''
\end{quote}

Here is a variation on that same theme:

\begin{quote}
``American Sign Language is a visual-gestural language used primarily by members of the North American Deaf community.''
\end{quote}

Now let's discuss those definitions a bit.

Did you notice the date of that entry from Merriam-Webster?
1960!
ASL hasn't been ``recognized'' as a language for very long has it?
Oh sure, ASL has been used in; America since the early 1800's (and earlier if you include the signing that was being done in America prior to Thomas Gallaudet bringing Laurent Clerc from France), but it wasn't until 1960 that ``experts'' \emph{started} recognizing it as a full-blown autonomous language.

We should say ``at \emph{least}'' 500,000 people use ASL.
That is an \textbf{old} statistic from the 1980's.
My estimate is more along the lines of:
2 million people are using ASL on a daily basis and at least 500,000 of those people are using it as their primary means of communication.
Millions more people know ``some'' sign language and use it ``once in a while.''
For example, a grandmother of a deaf child.
She may have taken a six-week community education course and now she knows just enough to offer her grandson candy and cookies.

``ASL is a visually perceived, gesture-based language.''
That means it is a language that is expressed through the hands and face and is perceived through the eyes.
It isn't just  waving your hands in the air.
If you furrow your eyebrows, tilt your head, glance in a certain direction, twist your body a certain way, puff your cheek, or any number of other ``inflections'' --- you are adding or changing meaning in ASL.
A ``visual gestural'' language carries just as much information as an oral/aural (mouth/ear) language.

Is ASL limited to just the United States and Canada?

No.
ASL is also used \textbf{\emph{in varying degrees}} in the Philippines, Ghana, Nigeria, Chad, Burkina Faso, Gabon, Zaire, Central African Republic, Cote d'Ivoire, Mauritania, Kenya, Madagascar, Benin, Togo, Zimbabwe, Singapore, Hong Kong and many other places.
{\small (Source: Grimes, Barbara F. (editor), (1996). ``Languages of USA'' \emph{Ethnologue: Languages of the World, 13th Edition.} Institute of Linguistics.)}

Is ASL a \textbf{\emph{universal}} language?
Nope.
Not even close.
Those countries I just mentioned also have \emph{their own} signed languages.
For a idea into how non-universal it is, take a look at the number of languages listed on \texttt{https://www.signbank.org/signmaker.html}!
ASL is the dominant signed language in \emph{North America}, plus it is used \emph{to some extent} in quite a few other countries, but it is certainly not understood by Deaf people everywhere.

\subsection{American Sign Language: Handshapes}

A student wrote:
``I was looking at some of the signs, but couldn't tell which way my hands should be facing.
For example one of the versions of the sign pizza uses a `p' handshape.
Is the `P' facing me or the person I'm signing to?''

\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{images/handsh1.jpg}
Dr Vicars:
When fingerspelling, in general the palm of your hand faces toward the watcher.
For the sake of comfort your palm is actually pointed a bit off to the right of the person to whom you are spelling.
(Unless you are left handed, then it will be opposite.)

Letters like G, H, and P point a bit off to the right of the person to whom you are signing.
Some signers point these letters almost directly to the left.
Both methods are ``okay.''
Use a position that feels comfortable to you yet is clear to the observer.
In most pictorial sign language dictionaries, unless it says or shows otherwise, you can assume the sign is angled toward the watcher.
It is important to note though that sometimes when you aim a sign at yourself or move a sign toward yourself you are doing so to create additional meaning.
(Mine vs. yours / done to me vs. done to you.)

When it comes to writing these letters, for now just ``draw'' them in a column down the page.
We will cover how to correctly write them in future lessons.

\subsubsection{A:}

When reading ``letter A'' it will look like B510x508S1f720490x493.
When watching someone else sign you the letter ``A'', it will look like \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{images/a.jpg} to you.
When writing ``letter A'' you should make it look like \tikz{\draw[thick](0,0)rectangle(10pt,10pt);\draw[thick](0,0)--(10pt,10pt);\draw[thick](0,10pt)--(10pt,0);\draw[thick](0,0)--(-5pt,5pt);}.

Don't worry too much about how to read and write ``A'' for now (unless it's in your name).
Just know for now that a filled in area is drawn by using an ``X'' to fill it in and that we will be showing the SignWriting for each of these handshapes along with the picture.

When writing your full name:
\begin{tabular}{p{1cm}p{14cm}}
\bul keep the letters centered in a column;\\
\bul for each hand, draw the palm with it's fill (almost all of them are an ``X'');\\
\bul then decorate each palm with fingers.\\
\end{tabular}

\subsubsection{B:}

``B'' Version 1:
The thumb of the letter ``B'' generally has a ``slight'' bend, but not as much as depicted in most books.
The picture of ``B'' in my \texttt{http://asl.ms} website was taken in a series as I was spelling the ABC's.

You might notice that a ``B'' being produced after an ``A'' tends to have little or no bend.
If you videotape a skilled signer fingerspelling the word ``about'' at \emph{high} speed, the ``B'' will generally have little or no bend in the thumb.
If you video record that same person spelling of the term ``MBA'' the ``B'' will have a very noticeable bend.
The letter B is spelled B507x511S14720493x489 regardless of any signing differences, just like the different sounds for ``L'' are ignored when reading and writing English.
Here's how I do the letter ``B'' in general:

\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{images/b1.jpg}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{images/b.jpg}

``B'' Version 2:
Some people cross the thumb over the palm.
I don't do it this way because it takes too much effort.
(Hey, I'm not lazy, just efficient.)
This is how most ``books'' show it:

\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{images/b1.jpg}

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Shannon:}
What is a ``b'' palm?
It doesn't relate to signing the letter ``b'' right?

\textbf{DrVicars}:
When used to describe a sign, a ``b'' palm is like the letter ``b'' but you don't have to bend the thumb around onto the palm.
The thumb is just alongside the palm in a natural position, with the fingers touching each other (side by side, extended).
Think of a traffic cop telling oncoming traffic to stop.

\textbf{Shannon}:
Okay that's what I guessed; just wanted to make sure.
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{``Classifier B,'' ``Flat hand,'' or ``B palm.''}

This handshape uses a ``B'' hand with the thumb alongside instead of folded across the palm.
This handshape is used to describe flat, rectangular objects or surfaces.
Examples:
the roof of a house, a sheet of paper, a table, a box $\ldots$

B506x514S15a20494x487
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{images/flat.jpg}

\subsubsection{C:}

B509x510S16d20492x490
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{images/c.jpg}

When used as a \textbf{size} and \textbf{shape} specifier this handshape shows things that are round or cylindrical.
Examples: pole, cup, or telescope.
This handshape can also be used to specify placement.
You could show where certain things are in a room.
For example, a TV or a microwave.
To describe a TV or microwave you could use \textbf{index} fingers to trace its outline, or \textbf{b-hands} to show its size and shape.

\subsubsection{D:}

B508x515S10110492x485
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{images/d.jpg}

\subsubsection{E:}

B508x508S14a20493x493
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{images/e.jpg}

You might see an ``e'' that rests only three fingers on top of the thumb when someone is spelling a name or a word that places the letter ``m'' before the ``e.''
For example: ``James.''

\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{images/e3.jpg}

Or suppose you spell the name ``J-A-N-E?''
The ``E'' might end up looking like this:

\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{images/e2.jpg}

There is even a version of ``E'' that uses only ``one'' finger (the index finger perched on top of the thumb).
This version often shows up after the letter ``L.''
None of these variations changes the symbol used to write the ``E'', just like you still spell ``input'' even if a particular speaker says something more like ``i{\footnotesize nm}put.''
The particular ``E'' used is not a separate letter, it's just a part of that signer's accent!

Note:
Sometimes you'll see people do an ``e'' with an opening between the fingertips and the thumb.
I sometimes call that a ``screaming E'' or a ``Hearing person's E.''
(Some people call it a ``bear claw E.'')
However it is fairly common in the Deaf Community and even used by quite a few Deaf people.
I recommend that ASL teachers stay flexible --- just like Spanish teachers have accepted several forms of the ``d'' sound.
I also recommend we not consider it ``wrong'' but simply another version of ``E'' that shows up from time to time depending on the person's particular accent. 

\subsubsection{F:}

B511x515S1ce20489x485
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{images/f.jpg}

Tip:
Do ``not'' get hung up on debating if the tip of the finger is on top of the thumb or the pad of the index finger is on top of the thumb.
The exact form of an ``F'' varies a bit depending on surrounding letters.
However --- some people care ``a lot.''
If you have the unfortunate experience of being taught by such a person just smile and do it their way.

\subsubsection{G:}

B515x508S1f000486x493
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{images/g1.jpg}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{images/g2.jpg}

You'll also see a ``G'' done with the thumb jutting up.
That is just another variation.

\subsubsection{H:}

B515x508S11502485x493
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{images/h1.jpg}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{images/h2.jpg}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{images/h3.jpg}

You'll also see an ``H'' done with the thumb jutting up.
That is just another variation.

\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{images/i.jpg}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{images/i1.jpg}

\subsubsection{L:}

B512x515S1dc20488x485
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{images/l.jpg}

\subsubsection{M:}

Three fingers draped over the thumb.

B510x513S18d20490x488
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{images/m1.jpg}

In books you often see the fingers draped way over the thumb, like this:

\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{images/m2.jpg}

You'll see it both ways, but think about which version would naturally become more popular over the years due to ease of use.
It takes extra time to drape the fingers further over the thumb.
So you can see why the ``loose method'' is more popular amongst everyday users of ASL and also why the SignWriting symbol is the looser B510x513S18d20490x488 instead of a tight B508x509S20020493x491.

When most skilled signers fingerspell letters like ``M, N, \& T,'' they don't bend or wrap the fingers as tightly as the ``ABC'' alphabet charts tend to depict.
The same for not bending the thumb over the palm in the letter ``B.''
Tightly wrapping the fingers over and/or around each other takes too much time.
An artist has a long time to draw pretty handshapes.
The artist can paint them carefully and in perfect form for the sign language dictionary pages.
A Deaf person whips out a several letters per second because he is trying to get his message across rather than impress somebody with how pretty his handshapes are.

\subsection{ASL Numbers Discussion}

\subsubsection{Numbers Discussion:}

Bill's first rule of doing numbers:
ff it hurts, don't do it.

Your hand should be held in a comfortable position.
Try this:
lift your hand into the air in front of your torso.
Don't worry about trying to point your hand ``exactly'' straight ahead or straight back.
Just adjust your palm orientation until you feel the least stress and the most comfort.
Find that ``comfortable position.''
Now you are ready to start doing your numbers.

If you are taking a sign language class from an in-person instructor who prefers you do the numbers a certain way, by all means follow the guidance of your local instructor!
The version(s) I show you on this website are (in general) very good versions.
Your local instructor however should be familiar with any local versions that might be more appropriate for your area.
Or if you notice the Deaf people in your area tending to do it one way or the other, follow their lead.

In the pages here I'll be sharing with you some specific rules for how to do the numbers.
For example, ``When done in isolation, numbers 1 through 5 are generally done palm back.''
Try to stay flexible though because there are often exceptions to those rules.

For example in I just told you that ``When done in isolation, numbers 1 through 5 are generally done palm back.''
(Which is to say, the palm of your hand is facing back toward you and is why the SignWriting symbols are empty)
However if those numbers are part of a series (such as a phone number) they are instead done palm forward.
This may or may not affect the SignWriting --- just like you would write numbers in English instead of writing down words.
Thus it depends on the circumstances.

I once watched Randal King, an excellent native signer give an example of circumstances when numbers and ``day signs'' (such as Monday, Tuesday, etc.) might be done palm forward.
He roleplayed (kidding around) an ``arrogant'' individual and signed a phrase to a pretend employee.
He told the ``employee'' that he wanted the employee finish a report and turn it in --- ``and I want it on Monday!!!''
The last two signs in his sentence were, WANT MONDAY!!!
Which would normally be B534x543S14c30507x457S14c38469x458S15030508x512S15038467x511S26504512x491S26514474x491S2fb04493x505 B512x528S2e508489x501S18d00489x473.
As Randal signed Monday, he extended his arm outward toward the person he was signing to and did the sign MONDAY palm forward (instead of palm back) using a strong motion and strong facial expression or B534x543S14c30507x457S14c38469x458S15030508x512S15038467x511S26504512x491S26514474x491S2fb04493x505 B518x626S2e508493x599S18d20489x525S26600495x554S34200482x483S2f900498x589.

Thus we see that some signs that are normally done palm back (or up) are occasionally done palm forward for \emph{emphasis} and that though we normally will not change SignWriting for signing difference (that is we \emph{ignore accent}) we can change SignWriting when we want to show deliberate changes for things like emphasis.
I might do the sign for ``3'' (B512x515S11e00489x485) palm forward (B512x515S11e20489x485) to someone if for some reason I wanted to \emph{emphasize} the number.

However, exceptions are exactly that, ``exceptions.''
Stick with the general rules but stay flexible.

\subsubsection{Questions and answers:}

\textbf{Daniel:}
Do I read the pictures right?
Is the sign for ``2'' and the sign for ``V'' the same?

\textbf{DrVicars:}
Yes, 2 (B508x515S10e00493x485) and ``V'' (B508x515S10e20493x485) use the same handshape.
However, when done as an isolated number the number 2 is generally done palm facing backward.

In normal conversation mixed letters and numbers are not an issue.
Context generally makes it clear.
For example, my last name:
``Vicars,'' you wouldn't misunderstand that as ``2icars.''
Sure, in some situations it might be more challenging.

Suppose you were fingerspelling your screen name to someone and it had some numbers mixed in with the letters.

One way to deal with ``2'' and ``V'' is to sign the letter palm forward (B508x508S20320493x493) and the number palm back (B508x508S20300493x493).

To differentiate 6/W (both B509x515S18720491x486) and 9/F (both B511x515S1ce20489x485) you can use internal motion in the number.
For example ----
the number ``6'' ---
you can tap the pinkie on the thumb a couple times (B522x516S21800504x493S14420478x485 or B519x515S18720482x486S21d00501x503) and it is obvious it is a 6 and not a ``W.''
The number ``9'' you can tap the tip of the index finger on the thumb (B521x516S21800479x485S14420499x485 or B520x515S1ce20498x485S21d00480x493).
This is just like you might add the spelling of two/too/to in certain contexts even when speaking or put an extra mark on a 2 or Z or 0 or O to allow you to differentiate them in writing.

Another way I've seen takes place in some corporate or academic environments where the signers might have to frequently communicate long strings of mixed letters and numbers is to do the letters normally, but place the numbers up against the palm of the non-dominant hand (like B516x520S18720498x480S15a28484x493).

\rightline{--- Dr. Bill}

\textbf{Sharp:}
I found it difficult to sign the letter F am I trying to straighten the fingers too much?

\textbf{DrVicars:}
I only straighten the pinkie and ring fingers when doing an ``F'' or ``9.''
I let the middle bend half-way.
Does that help?

\textbf{Sharp:}
Thanks.

\subsubsection{SignWriting multi-digit numbers:}

In general, when writing two or more digits you will write them as individual digits in a column.
You may sign B513x528S2a538494x472S1f540488x504 but write B509x527S10000492x473S17610493x511.
(You may even write B509x527S10100492x473S17600493x511 just for speed if you are writing down a number as someone is signing to you, though you shouldn't see this in a published document.)

\subsubsection{Advanced number discussion:}

\textbf{DrVicars:}
When you sign numbers, you do them quite similar to the way they are said in English.
For example:
If you are signing ``1997,'' you sign ``19'' then ``97.''

If you do a phone number, just do it as you would say it.
I leave a small pause where the hyphen would be so the watcher can write the first part (if they are writing it down), before I do the second part.

\textbf{Years:}

You'll still see a bit of variety for the years 2000--2009.
Most people do the individual numbers while sliding the hand slightly to the right.

&nbsp; <br>
	The number 2009 is two-zero-zero-nine all in one smooth movement sliding 
	slightly to the ourside. <br>
	You may see variations, but that is the way I recommend you sign the years 
    2000-2009. I have on occasion observed a few of my friends using the 
	&quot;thousand&quot; sign as part of the sign for years 2000 and up, but I don't 
	recommend you use the &quot;thousand&quot; sign for &quot;years.&quot;</p>
	<hr>Numbering for <strong>Lefties</strong>:<br>
	<br>
	For lefties:&nbsp; Most numbers are either signed without sideward movement or with only a very slight movement further to the 
	left. (Again, I'm discussing how left handed people do numbers.&nbsp; I know someone is going to &quot;miss that&quot; and run around 
	saying that Dr. V said such and such.&nbsp; Wake up.)<br>
	For example: The number &quot;57&quot; is commonly held in place as it changes from a &quot;5&quot; into a &quot;7.&quot;&nbsp; For lefties it would also be 
	okay to use a very small leftward movement as you change from a 5 to a 7--but why waste energy?<br>
	<br>
	For Lefties:&nbsp; Double numbers:&nbsp; 22, 33, 44, 55, ... start palm forward and a bit downward (45% angle), slap downward, come 
	up and move to the left in a small arc (toward the outside) and slap downward again.<br>
	<br>
	Numbering for <strong>Lefties</strong>:<br>
	Numbers 21, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29:<br>
	Start with an &quot;L&quot; handshape and move slightly to the left (or simply &quot;do in place&quot; without moving to the left) and then do the 
	next digit.&nbsp; For example, &quot;24&quot; would look like &quot;L4&quot;<br>
	Notes:&nbsp; The number 21 tends to move the thumb twice, for example&nbsp;&quot;L1L1&quot; and/or hold it pointing&nbsp;somewhat forward at an angle 
	as if shooting a gun (the thumb looking somewhat like the hammer of a pistol coming down twice).&nbsp; It is also common to instead 
	move the index finger&nbsp;as if &quot;pulling a&nbsp;trigger&quot; twice.<br>
	&nbsp;<hr>
	<p>General notes:<br>
	<br>
	The number 23 uses a palm-forward &quot;3 handshape&quot; and wiggles the middle finger downward a couple times.<br>
	The number 25 uses a palm-forward &quot;5 handshape&quot; and wiggles the middle finger downward a couple times.</p>
	<div>
		The numbers 6-9 are palm forward.</div>
	<div>
		16 - 19 use a palm back (or side) to palm forward twist.<br>
		The numbers 30 on up are palm forward.<br>
		The repeated digits like 33, 44, 55, etc. are palm forward but slap 
		downward twice.<br>
		111 - 113&nbsp;start palm&nbsp;forward and turn backward for the second part of 
		the sign.</div>

\subsection{A Very Brief History of SignWriting}

\begin{quote}
\begin{center}
{\it This is a brief extract from} \texttt{www.signwriting.org/library/history}.

{\it Please feel free to do some additional reading.}
\end{center}
\end{quote}

Valerie Sutton invented a notation to record the movements of ballet as part of her dance studies.
She then moved to Copenhagen to train in the Danish Royal Ballet and began to record their movements to prevent the loss of ballet through time.
Some people researching Danish Sign Language read a newspaper article about it and contacted her to record the movements of signing---this became the earliest form of SignWriting.

When Valerie Sutton returned home her research turned to recording ASL.
Soon books, articles, pamphlets, and even a newsletter began to be written in ASL using SignWriting.
Then SignWriting began to be put into a computer, and with that SignWriting became simplified, abstract, and regular.

It was during this time that Deaf users of SignWriting demanded that SignWriting switch from recording what a researcher sees (receptive) to what a signer does (expressive).
Then the direction changed from horizontal to vertical.

Today it is used unofficially for close to sixty sign languages and is the official writing system for Brazilian Sign Language with, hopefully, more to follow.

\subsection{Direction of Reading and Writing}

A full word in ASL can consist of a face along with movement and handshapes that change over the course of movement.
If SignWriting is written horizontally, as it was initially, then you are left with a word which is half iconic with individual parts of the word being iconic but those parts being horizontally separated from each other.
So, of course, individual words have long been written vertically even if the words were strung along horizontally.

Along with writing ASL came a better understanding of the grammar of ASL and a way to write role shifting was required.
The simplest way to accomplish this?
Write the words vertically and place them in the correct column corresponding to the role.

Today all SignWriting is written vertically, from the top of the page to the bottom of the page, with columns of text moving from the left of the page to the top of the page.

\subsection{How Do I Remember Over 10,000 Letters?}

Yes, that is correct.
SignWriting has about ten thousand ``letters'', though there are a couple things that make this less daunting.

The first thing to remember is that ASL doesn't use every letter, just like even if English was written in the International Phonetic Alphabet it would not require all hundred or so letters.
SignWriting is usable for all sign languages, and even though we will be learning \emph{about} the whole system we will focus on the \emph{part} that ASL uses.

The second thing to know is that SignWriting isn't just a list of ten thousand letters, but organized into related groups.
So when you see B516x515S14521484x485, its not just \emph{symbol 7,520.}
It's \emph{Category One, Symbol Group Four Fingers, Second Symbol, Fill Three, Rotation One}.

The levels of organization for SignWriting are:

\begin{tabular}{p{1cm}p{14cm}}
\hfil 1.&\textbf{Category.}
Every symbol in SignWriting fits into one of these seven categories.\\
\hfil 2.&\textbf{Symbol group.}
Each category has between one and ten symbol groups for a total of thirty symbol groups which you will eventually know as well as you know your own alphabet.\\
\hfil 3.&\textbf{Base symbol.}
Each symbol group has a number of base symbols, and you should learn the order of these but you will not need to know all of them.\\
\hfil 4.&\textbf{Fill}.
Each base symbol has between one and six fills.\\
\hfil 5.&\textbf{Rotation}.
Each fill has between one and sixteen different rotations, though it tends to be regular enough that it can be ignored when identifying a symbol.\\
\end{tabular}

\subsection{The Basics of Dictionary Order}

Let's start by pointing out that we don't have a dictionary, we have a glossary.
If we had a dictionary then we would include information about scope, alternates, pronunciation (formation) helps, and even point to additional words to look at.
All of this information is available at \texttt{https://www.lifeprint.com/dictionary.htm} but we only list glosses --- basic word correspondence.

Second, let's comparing the order of our glossary with the order of a typical English dictionary.

\begin{tabular}{p{1mm}*{2}{p{7cm}}}
1.&
Even if you don't know whether \# comes before \emph{apple} or after \emph{zebra} you know that punctuation marks will be grouped together.&
SignWriting symbols are grouped by their functional categories.\\
2.&
Alphabetic order is arbitrary. The letter \emph{A} comes before \emph{B} simply because of where the Romans borrowed them from.&
The order is arbitrary, someone picked it.\\
3.&
The exact rules being followed vary slightly on purpose. For instance, author lists will treat \emph{Mac} and \emph{Mc} as a separate letter between \emph{M} and \emph{N}.&
This sorting follows the international standard but you may find different ways to sort in other places.\\
4.&
We sort word by word so \emph{I Read} comes before \emph{In May}.&
These rules are for sorting words.\\
5.&
Shorter words come before longer words so \emph{pen} comes before \emph{penmanship}.&
% I can't seem to use \f@size in a raisbox!
Words like \raisebox{-4mm}{{\setmainfont{SuttonSignWritingLine.ttf}\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\selectfont\begin{tikzpicture}\draw(10/30*0 pt,10/30*1 pt) node [anchor=north west] {\char983049};\draw(10/30*6 pt,10/30*-6 pt) node [anchor=north west] {\char983073};\draw(10/30*5 pt,10/30*-41 pt) node [anchor=north west] {\char1017409};\end{tikzpicture}}} come before words like \raisebox{-5mm}{{\setmainfont{SuttonSignWritingLine.ttf}\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\selectfont\begin{tikzpicture}\draw(10/30*0 pt,10/30*-31 pt) node [anchor=north west] {\char983049};\draw(10/30*6 pt,10/30*-38 pt) node [anchor=north west] {\char983073};\draw(10/30*5 pt,10/30*-73 pt) node [anchor=north west] {\char1017409};\draw(10/30*1 pt,10/30*0 pt) node [anchor=north west] {\char1017429};\end{tikzpicture}}}.\\
\end{tabular}

For English, that's the end of the story because one sound comes at a time; but in ASL more than one thing can be happening at the same time so we have to decide how to handle both simultaneous and sequential activity.
A full sign is first broken into syllables based generally on sequential ordering.

B566x629S30a00482x483S11817490x522S15a06487x555S2970b515x543S15a36533x617S20b00553x599S10e30530x593 \raisebox{9mm}{becomes}
\begin{tabular}{p{1cm}p{11cm}}
\hfil 1.&\textbf{Syllable 1.}
Hands beginning position --- B514x523S11817489x478S15a06486x511\\
\hfil 2.&\textbf{Syllable 2.}
Movement between hand positions --- {B519x519S2970b481x482}\\
\hfil 3.&\textbf{Syllable 3.}
Hands ending position --- {B518x518S15a36485x506S20b00505x488S10e30482x482}\\
\hfil 4.&\textbf{Syllable 4.}
Everything else --- {B518x518S30a00482x483}\\
\end{tabular}

We are literally following the order of a verbal description of how to sign.
``First to make your primary hand into a bent V shape, your secondary hand int a flat hand'' which makes for our first syllable.
``Then you move your primary hand in a downward loop while moving your secondary hand down'' which makes for our second syllable.
``Then a V handshape hits the back of a B handshape'' which makes for our third syllable.
Everything else goes into the final syllable.
For longer or compound words we extend this pattern of basing the syllables on a verbal description of how to sign the word.

You might notice that we left some of the movement of the secodary hand implied.
This is a fairly common practice in day-to-day SignWriting because the secondary hand is \emph{secondary}.

Within each of these syllables we consider all the simultaneous things that can occur in a certain order.
We don't use any mark to show separation of syllables but the odd syllables contain handshapes and occassionally contact, the even syllables (except the last) contain movement and often contact, the last syllable has anything leftover.

For odd syllables we sort the right hand (\raisebox{3mm}{\setmainfont{SuttonSignWritingLine.ttf}\char985368}, \raisebox{3mm}{\setmainfont{SuttonSignWritingLine.ttf}\char984433}), then the left (\raisebox{2mm}{\setmainfont{SuttonSignWritingLine.ttf}\char991687}, \raisebox{2mm}{\setmainfont{SuttonSignWritingLine.ttf}\char991735}), then the finger movment, and finally contact (\raisebox{2mm}{\setmainfont{SuttonSignWritingLine.ttf}\char1008673}).

For even syllables, except the last, we sort finger movement, contact, right hand movement (\raisebox{3mm}{\setmainfont{SuttonSignWritingLine.ttf}\char1022124}), simultaneous movement, and finally left hand movement.

For the last syllable we just follow the arbitrary order we will be learning over this and the next several supplements.

This does have the side effect that which syllable finger movement and contact exists in is technically up for interpretation.
Consider the description we gave verses ``you move your primary hand in a downward loop to strike the back of the b hand after your secondary hand moved down'' ---
which syllable does the strike contact belong to?
That's really open to interpretation.

\subsection{SignWriting and Left Handed Signing}

Throughout these lessons I refer to right and left hands.
It would be most accurate to call them dominant and non-dominant hands.
When using SignWriting to read ASL the dominant hand visually appears as if it is the right hand and is placed on the right side.

Of course, for your own writing you are free to draw the sign anyway you would prefer, but for purposes of these supplements we assume right-handed signers.

\subsection{Practice Sheet 1.A}

In addition to vocabulary, anytime you write there are additional conventions which exist outside of the spoken (or signed) word.
For instance, if the practice sentence said something like: ``1. \textquestiondown C\'omo se llama?'', you wouldn't practice saying ``One dot inverted question mark c\'omo se llama question mark''.
Even when you learn the names of these symbols, you still wouldn't say ``Uno punto signo de apertura de interrogaci\'on c\'omo se llama signo de interrogac\'ion''!
You use the punctuation as markers for what to practice and how to speak.

It's just that in a language like Spanish, you already know most of the punctuation and what it means because of shared literary history.
When writing ASL, those marks don't work very well with the other symbols so there are new symbols to learn.
So for practice sheet 1.A we are going to have a side by side gloss of every symbol and discuss what it going on.
Then you will be expected to apply that knowledge in all additional practice sheets, and we will continue warn you about new punctuation.

B530x508S38b04470x493&)&This normally would be paired with an opening parentheses as well.
The fact that we have a closing parentheses without an opening parentheses points out that this separates the counter from the actual sentence to practice.
Comma (two straight lines) is another common punctuation to use here.&

\subsection{Practice Sheet 1.B}

There are two things to notice in this practice sheet.
The first is that we have the numbers for 6--9 and zero, but don't worry about these yet as that's for lessons 2 and 5.
Just know that we will be numbering these much like we would in English.

The second thing to notice is the sign for who.
There are two ways to deal with this word depending on the overall context of the sentence.
You can write the eyebrows followed by a head without eyebrows to indicate ``first adjust your eyebrows to show you are asking a question and then do the sign for who'' and that is a perfectly acceptable way to write it.
This is especially true if the question starts before the word who.
You can also write the eyebrows as part of the sign for who, and that is a perfectly acceptable way to write it.

The third is the comma or \begin{tabular}{c}B537x504S38700463x496\end{tabular} in number seven which \emph{is} part of the practice.
In this case it represents a brief pause in signing.

The final is \begin{tabular}{c}B536x511S38a00464x490\\B536x511S38a00464x490\\\end{tabular} in number ten, which is ``::''.
This is a stand in for \_\_\_\_\_ or $\ldots$ --- it means that there is something to practice which we have not fully specified.
In the case of question ten, you are supposed to spell someone's name.
In the case of the practice story, it means to fill in your details --- practice your story and not someone else's.

\subsection{Practice Sheet 1.C}

Number eleven introduces a new punctuation mark of \begin{tabular}{c}B536x504S38800464x496\end{tabular} or period.
It simply marks the end of a statement.
You draw it by drawing two lines and then connecting them by making an wide ``X'' between the lines.
