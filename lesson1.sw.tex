\subsection{A Brief Description of ASL}

Let me start by sharing with you \emph{my} definition of ASL:
``American Sign Language is a visually perceived language based on a naturally evolved system of articulated hand gestures and their placement relative to the body, along with non-manual markers such as facial expressions, head movements, shoulder raises, mouth morphemes, and movements of the body.''

Now let's look at a couple of other definitions.
According to \texttt{www.dictionary.com} we have:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{American Sign Language} \textit{n. Abbr.} \textbf{ASL}:
The primary sign language used by deaf and hearing-impaired people in the United States and Canada, devised in part by Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet on the basis of sign language in France.
Also called \textbf{Ameslan}.
\end{quote}

A quick trip to Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary (\texttt{www.m-w.com}) and we get:

\begin{tabular}{rp{10cm}}
Main Entry:&\textbf{American Sign Language}\\
Function:&\emph{noun}\\
Date:&1960\\
\textbf{:}&a sign language for the deaf in which meaning is conveyed by a system of articulated hand gestures and their placement relative to the upper body\\
\end{tabular}

I've also seen this definition show up in \emph{many} places:

\begin{quote}
``American Sign Language is a visual-gestural language used by 500,000 members of the North American Deaf community.''
\end{quote}

Here is a variation on that same theme:

\begin{quote}
``American Sign Language is a visual-gestural language used primarily by members of the North American Deaf community.''
\end{quote}

\begin{tabular}{p{1cm}p{14cm}}

\bul I know and can read the common handshapes used in ASL.\\

    Did you notice the date of that entry from Merriam-Webster?&nbsp; 1960!&nbsp; ASL hasn't been &quot;recognized&quot; as a language for 
	very long has it?&nbsp; Oh sure, ASL has been used in&nbsp; America since the early 1800's (and earlier if you include the 
	signing that was being done in America prior to Thomas Gallaudet bringing Laurent Clerc from France), but it wasn't until 1960 that &quot;experts&quot; <i>started</i>
    recognizing it as a full-blown autonomous language.<p>We should say &quot;at <i> least</i>&quot; 500,000 people use ASL.&nbsp; That is an
    OLD statistic from the 1980's.&nbsp; My estimate
    is more along the lines of: 2 million people are using ASL on a daily basis and
    at least 500,000 of those people are using it as their primary means of communication.&nbsp;
    Millions more people know &quot;some&quot; sign language and use it
    &quot;once in a while.&quot;&nbsp; For example, a grandmother of a deaf
    child.&nbsp; She may have taken a six-week community education course and
    now she knows just enough to offer her grandson candy and
    cookies.&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>&quot;ASL
    is a visually perceived, gesture-based language.&quot;&nbsp;That means it is a language that 
    is expressed through the hands and face and is perceived through the eyes.&nbsp; It isn't just  waving your 
    hands
    in the air.&nbsp; If you furrow your eyebrows, tilt your head, glance in a
    certain direction, twist your body a certain way, puff your cheek, or any
    number of other &quot;inflections&quot; --you are adding or changing meaning
    in ASL.&nbsp; A &quot;visual gestural&quot; language carries just as much information as an oral/aural (mouth/ear) language.<p>
				Is ASL limited to just the United States and Canada?&nbsp; <br>
				No.&nbsp; ASL is also used <b><i>in varying degrees</i></b> in the Philippines, 
				Ghana, Nigeria, Chad, Burkina Faso, Gabon, Zaire, Central 
				African Republic, Cote d'Ivoire, Mauritania, Kenya, Madagascar, 
				Benin, Togo, Zimbabwe, Singapore, Hong Kong and many other 
				places. <font size="2">(Source:&nbsp; Grimes, Barbara F. (editor), 
				(1996). &quot;Languages of USA&quot; <u>Ethnologue: Languages of the 
				World, 13th Edition.</u> Institute of Linguistics.)</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Is ASL a 
	<i><b>universal</b></i> 
    language?&nbsp; Nope.&nbsp; Not
    even close.&nbsp; Those countries I just&nbsp; mentioned also have <i>their own</i> signed
    languages.&nbsp; ASL is the dominant signed language in
    <i>North America</i>, plus it is used <i>to some extent</i> in quite a few other 
    countries, but it is certainly not understood by Deaf people everywhere.</blockquote>

\subsection{Writing Your Name In SignWriting}

Take a small peek into supplement 2 for a list of symbols for fingerspelling.
With how visual SignWriting is, you can start by just ``drawing'' them while remembering:

\begin{tabular}{p{1cm}p{14cm}}
\bul keep the letters centered in a column;\\
\bul for each hand, draw the palm with it's fill;\\
\bul then decorate each palm with fingers.\\
\end{tabular}

\subsection{A Very Brief History of SignWriting}

\begin{quote}
\begin{center}
\emph{This is almost an extract from \emph{www.signwriting.org/library/history}.}

\emph{Please feel free to do some additional reading.}
\end{center}
\end{quote}

Valerie Sutton invented a notation to record the movements of ballet as part of her dance studies.
She then movend to Copenhagen to train in the Danish Royal Ballet and began to record their movements to prevent the loss of ballet through time.
Some people researching Danish Sign Language read a newspaper article about it and contacted her to record the movements of signing---this became the earliest form of SignWriting.

When Valerie Sutton returned home her research turned to recording ASL.
Soon books, articles, pamphlets, and even a newsletter began to be written in ASL using SignWriting.
Then SignWriting began to be put into a computer, and with that SignWriting became simplified, abstract, and regular.

It was during this time that Deaf users of SignWriting demanded that SignWriting switch from recording what a researcher sees (receptive) to what a signer does (expressive).
Then the direction changed from horizontal to vertical.

Today it is used for close to sixty sign languages, with more than a dozen langugae codes, and is the official writing system for Brazilian Sign Language.

\subsection{Direction of Reading and Writing}

A full word in ASL can consist of a face along with movement and handshapes that change over the course of movement.
If SignWriting is written horizontally, as it was initially, then you are left with a word which is half iconic with individual parts of the word being iconic but thos parts being horizontally separated from eachother.
So, of course, inidivdual words have long been written vertically even if the words were strung along horizontally.

Along with writing ASL came a better understanding of the grammar of ASL and a way to write role shifting was required.
The simplest way to accomplish this?
Write the words vertically and place them in the correct column corresponding to the role.

Today all SignWriting is written vertically, from the top of the page to the bottom of the page, with columns of text moving from the left of the page to the top ef the page.

\subsection{How Do I Remember Over 10,000 Letters?}

Yes, that is correct.
SignWriting has about ten thousand ``letters'', though there are a couple things that make this less daunting.

The first thing to remember is that ASL doesn't use every letter, just like even if English was written in the International Phonetic Alphabet it would not require all hundred or so letters.
SignWriting is usable for all sign languages, and even though we will be learning \emph{about} the whole system we will focus on the \emph{part} that ASL uses.

The second thing to know is that SignWriting isn't just a list of ten thousand letters, but organized into related groups.
So when you see B516x515S14521484x485, its not just \emph{symbol 7,520.}
It's \emph{Category One, Symbol Group Four Fingers, Second Symbol, Fill Three, Rotation One}.

The levels of organization for SignWriting are:

\begin{tabular}{p{1cm}p{14cm}}
\hfil 1.&\textbf{Category.}
Every symbol in SignWriting fits into one of these seven categories.\\
\hfil 2.&\textbf{Symbol group.}
Each category has between one and ten symbol groups for a total of thirty symbol groups which you will eventually know as well as you know your own alphabet.\\
\hfil 3.&\textbf{Base symbol.}
Each symbol group has a number of base symbols, the closest thing corresponding to a letter.\\
\hfil 4.&\textbf{Fill}.
Each base symbol has between one and six fills.\\
\hfil 5.&\textbf{Rotation}.
Each fill has between one and sixteen different rotations, though it tends to be regular enough that it can be ignored when identifying a symbol.\\
\end{tabular}

\subsection{The Basics of Dictionary Order}

Let's start by comparing the order of our glossary with the order of a typical English dictionary.

\begin{tabular}{p{1mm}*{2}{p{7cm}}}
1.&
Even if you don't know whether \# comes before \emph{apple} or after \emph{zebra} you know that punctuation marks will be grouped together.&
SignWriting symbols are grouped by their functional categories.\\
2.&
Alphabetic order is arbitrary. The letter \emph{A} comes before \emph{B} simply because of where the Romans borrowed them from.&
The order is arbitrary, someone picked it.\\
3.&
The exact rules being followed vary slightly on purpose. For instance, author lists will treat \emph{Mac} and \emph{Mc} as a separate letter between \emph{M} and \emph{N}.&
This sorting follows the international standard but you may find different ways to sort in other places.\\
4.&
We sort word by word so \emph{I Read} comes before \emph{In May}.&
These rules are for sorting words.\\
5.&
Shorter words come before longer words so \emph{pen} comes before \emph{penmanship}.&
% I can't seem to use \f@size in a raisbox!
Words like \raisebox{-4mm}{{\setmainfont{SuttonSignWritingLine.ttf}\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\selectfont\begin{tikzpicture}\draw(10/30*0 pt,10/30*1 pt) node [anchor=north west] {\char983049};\draw(10/30*6 pt,10/30*-6 pt) node [anchor=north west] {\char983073};\draw(10/30*5 pt,10/30*-41 pt) node [anchor=north west] {\char1017409};\end{tikzpicture}}} come before words like \raisebox{-5mm}{{\setmainfont{SuttonSignWritingLine.ttf}\fontsize{10pt}{10pt}\selectfont\begin{tikzpicture}\draw(10/30*0 pt,10/30*-31 pt) node [anchor=north west] {\char983049};\draw(10/30*6 pt,10/30*-38 pt) node [anchor=north west] {\char983073};\draw(10/30*5 pt,10/30*-73 pt) node [anchor=north west] {\char1017409};\draw(10/30*1 pt,10/30*0 pt) node [anchor=north west] {\char1017429};\end{tikzpicture}}}.\\
\end{tabular}

For English, that's the end of the story because one sound comes at a time; but in ASL more than one thing can be happening at the same time so we have to decide how to handle both simultaneous and sequential activity.
A full sign is first broken into syllables based generally on sequential ordering.

B566x629S30a00482x483S11817490x522S15a06487x555S2970b515x543S15a36533x617S20b00553x599S10e30530x593 \raisebox{9mm}{becomes}
\begin{tabular}{p{1cm}p{11cm}}
\hfil 1.&\textbf{Syllable 1.}
Hands beginning position --- B514x523S11817489x478S15a06486x511\\
\hfil 2.&\textbf{Syllable 2.}
Movement between hand positions --- {B526x535S2970b475x466S20b00513x522}\\
\hfil 3.&\textbf{Syllable 3.}
Hands ending position --- {B515x518S15a36488x506S10e30485x482}\\
\hfil 4.&\textbf{Syllable 4.}
Everything else --- {B518x518S30a00482x483}\\
\end{tabular}

For longer or compound words we extend this pattern---hand shapes, movement, handshapes, movement, $\ldots$, handshapes, everything else.
Then within each of these syllables we consider all the simultaneous things that can occur in a certain order.

For odd syllables we sort the right hand (\raisebox{3mm}{\setmainfont{SuttonSignWritingLine.ttf}\char985368}, \raisebox{3mm}{\setmainfont{SuttonSignWritingLine.ttf}\char984433}), then the left (\raisebox{2mm}{\setmainfont{SuttonSignWritingLine.ttf}\char991687}, \raisebox{2mm}{\setmainfont{SuttonSignWritingLine.ttf}\char991735}).

For even syllables, except the last, we sort right hand movement (\raisebox{3mm}{\setmainfont{SuttonSignWritingLine.ttf}\char1022124}), simultaneous movement (\raisebox{2mm}{\setmainfont{SuttonSignWritingLine.ttf}\char1008673}), and finally left hand movement.

For the last syllable we just follow the arbitrary order we will be learning over the next several supplements.

\subsection{SignWriting and Left Handed Signing}

Throughout these lessons I refer to right and left hands.
It would be most accurate to call them dominant and non-dominant hands.
When using SignWriting to read ASL the dominant hand visually appears as if it is the right hand and is placed on the right side.

Of course, for your own writing you are free to draw the sign anyway you would prefer, but for purposes of these supplements we assume right-handed signers.
