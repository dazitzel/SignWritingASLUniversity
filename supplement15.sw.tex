\subsection{Symbol Group Detail}

The twenty-ninth Symbol Group we informally call detail.
In conversational ASL, you should never need these but if you want to add a note to yourself about how to get the correct accent these are the symbols to you.
Its official name is ``Detailed Location'', but you can now list off the symbol groups as ``one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, thumb, contact, fingers, wall, diagonal, floor, curve wall, hit wall, hit floor, curve floor, circles, timing, head, eyes, middle, lips, mouth, trunk, limb, detail''.

\begin{center}

Location Space Wall Plane&B521x521S37f00480x480&Location Space Floor Plane&B521x521S38000480x480\\

\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{Symbol Group Punctuation}

The thirtieth, and final, Symbol Group we informally call punctuation.
Its official name is also ``Punctuation'', but you can now list off the symbol groups as ``one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, thumb, contact, fingers, wall, diagonal, floor, curve wall, hit wall, hit floor, curve floor, circles, timing, head, eyes, middle, lips, mouth, trunk, limbs, detail, punctuation''.

\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{Thumb Handshape}

The thumb handshape starts with a fist and then the thumb is extended.
