\subsection{Symbol Group Timing}

The twenty-first Symbol Group we informally call timing.
It's official name is ``Dynamics \& Timing'', but you can now list off the symbol groups as ``one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, thumb, contact, fingers, wall, diagonal, floor, cerved wall, hit wall, hit floor, curved floor, circles, timing''.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{rcrc}
\textbf{Base Symbol}&\textbf{Example}&\textbf{Base Symbol}&\textbf{Example}\\
Fast            &B506x504S2f700494x497&Slow                 &B519x506S2f800481x495\\

\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{Symbol Group Head}

The twenty-second Symbol Group we informally call head.
It's official name is also ``Head'', but you can now list off the symbol groups as ``one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, thumb, contact, fingers, wall, diagonal, floor, cerved wall, hit wall, hit floor, curved floor, circles, timing, head''.

\subsection{Baby Thumb Handshape}

The baby thumb handshape is made by extending the baby finger and thumb and keeping the other fingers held tightly.

\subsection{Baby Thumb on Hinge Handshape}

The baby thumb on hinge handshape starts with a baby thumb handshape and extends the index, middle, and ring fingers the same direction as the palm is facing.

\subsection{Baby Index Thumb Handshape}

The baby index thumb starts as a fist with the baby finger, index finger, and thumb extended.

\subsection{Baby Index Thumb on Hinge Handshape}

The baby index thumb on hinge handshapes starts as a baby index thumb handshape and extends the middle and ring fingers the same direction as the palm is facing.
