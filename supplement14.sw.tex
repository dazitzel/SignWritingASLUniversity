\subsection{Symbol Group Trunk}

The twenty-seventh Symbol Group we informally call trunk.
Its official name is ``Brow Eyes Eyegaze'', but you can now list off the symbol groups as ``one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, thumb, contact, fingers, wall, diagonal, floor, curve wall, hit wall, hit floor, curve floor, circles, timing, head, eyes, middle, lips, mouth, trunk''.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{rcrc}

Shoulder Hip Spine                &B521x502S36d00479x498&Shoulder Hip Positions       &B523x506S36e00477x494\\

\subsection{Symbol Group Limbs}

The twenty-eighth Symbol Group we informally call limbs.
Its official name is also ``Limbs'', but you can now list off the symbol groups as ``one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, thumb, contact, fingers, wall, diagonal, floor, curve wall, hit wall, hit floor, curve floor, circles, timing, head, eyes, middle, lips, mouth, trunk, limbs''.
