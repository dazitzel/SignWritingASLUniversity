\subsection{Symbol Group Timing}

The twenty-first Symbol Group we informally call timing.
It's official name is ``Dynamics \& Timing'', but you can now list off the symbol groups as ``one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, thumb, contact, fingers, wall, diagonal, floor, cerved wall, hit wall, hit floor, curved floor, circles, timing''.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{rcrc}

Fast            &B506x504S2f700494x497&Slow                 &B519x506S2f800481x495\\

\end{tabular}

\subsection{Symbol Group Head}

The twenty-second Symbol Group we informally call head.
It's official name is also ``Head'', but you can now list off the symbol groups as ``one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, thumb, contact, fingers, wall, diagonal, floor, cerved wall, hit wall, hit floor, curved floor, circles, timing, head''.
