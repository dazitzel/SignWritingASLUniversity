# SignWritingASLUniversity

Latex supplements to teach SignWriting while learning from ASL University.

I've pulled together information from both https://www.lifeprint.com/ and  http://signwriting.org/ to attempt to learn ASL and SignWriting at the same time.

OK, that's not entirely true.
I learned some ASL years ago and have always wished I could write it down.
I then (years later) did some research into various methods to write ASL.
I started by using three or so methods to write ASL and dropped them as I found they weren't expressive enough for my purposes.

Then I finally decided I should learn for real, but ASL Unviversity relies upon videos and drawings while SignWriting is written to a Deaf audience.

After several false starts I think I'm actually happy enough with what I've come up with share the first 15 lessons.
As well as my experiment with an integrated version of lesson 1.
