\subsection{Symbol Group Hit Wall}

The seventeenth Symbol Group we informally call hit wall.
Its official name is ``Curves Hit Wall Plane'', but you can now list off the symbol groups as ``one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, thumb, contact, fingers, wall, diagonal, floor, curve wall, hit wall''.
